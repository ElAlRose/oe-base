# Dockerfile for openembedded development

[oe][oem] is a distribution-generator to build images of several distributions for 
embedded devices

This is a Dockerfile to generate an oe development environment for systems
other than ubuntu based. You can run bitbake etc. within this image.
But for developing you should use your native system.
